# 🌟 Excel VBA Job Tracker – Smart Automation for Career Management 🌟

## 🧩 Project Overview
In a competitive job market, staying organized and proactive is crucial for job seekers. This project presents a fully automated job application tracking system built in Excel using VBA and dynamic logic, designed to simplify application management, improve follow-up efficiency, and provide data-driven insights — all without subscriptions or third-party apps.

Inspired by SEEK’s mission to make job searching meaningful and productive, this tool empowers job seekers with real-time visibility and automation tailored to their job hunt.

## 🔧 Key Features
### 1️⃣ Auto-Updating Dashboard with Status Overview
Built dynamic dashboards to visualize:

Total applications and daily/monthly application trends

Application statuses: Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected, Ghosted

Industry and job level distribution

Source-wise effectiveness: SEEK, LinkedIn, company site

📊 Automatically refreshes on data change or via a single macro click.

### 2️⃣ Smart Reminder & Follow-Up Alerts
Implemented VBA logic to:

Track last_update and calculate days since last contact

Alert users if >7/14 days without status change

Highlight cold applications needing follow-up

Send visual reminders using message boxes or conditional formatting

🚨 Stay on top of every application — no more missed follow-ups.

### 3️⃣ Email Follow-Up Template Generator
Using contact_person, contact_email, job_title, and company_name, this macro:

Generates personalized email drafts

Pre-fills job-specific content to reduce effort

Opens Outlook with draft ready (or copy to clipboard)

✉️ Example:
“Hi Ms Sharifah, I’m following up on my application for the Data Analyst role at XYZ submitted on May 10…”

### 4️⃣ Application Source & Location Filtering
Built interactive filters and slicers for:

Job level, industry, and location

Application source performance (e.g., SEEK vs LinkedIn)

Show only interviews pending or awaiting feedback

🔍 Focus your energy where it matters most.

### 5️⃣ Visual Alerts and Application Funnel
Conditional formatting system:

🟥 Red for >14 days without update

🟨 Yellow for interviews with no recent feedback

🟩 Green for recent progress or offers

Created a funnel-style tracker:
Applied → Interview → Offer → Accepted/Rejected

🔄 See where you are across all applications in one glance.
